# Examples

The main focus is on programming as much as possible, as opposed to using a provided game editor, such as Unity.
Rust and Amethyst will be used for the examples.

- [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Amethyst](https://book.amethyst.rs/stable/)

There are other game engines made directly in Rust,
or that have Rust bindings.
