# Examples

The main focus is on programming as much as possible, as opposed to using a provided game editor, such as Unity.
Rust and Amethyst will be used for the examples.
Rust is a programming language.
Amethyst is a "game engine engine".
It provides many of the parts required to make a 3D game.
It uses an Entity-Component-System architecture.

There are other game engines made directly in Rust,
or that have Rust bindings.
