# Window management

Modern 3D games are required to run in a window.
A game will need to handle a set of things, loosely as follows:

- Different modes
  - Fullscreen mode,
  - Windowed mode
  - Borderless windowed mode
- Window events
  - Close event
  - Window resize
- Mouse events
  - Mouse movements
  - Mouse click, hold, drag
