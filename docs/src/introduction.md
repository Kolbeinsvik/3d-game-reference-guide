You can find more examples in the dedicated [resources section](./resources). The following is only a shortlist.

[Are we a game yet?](https://arewegameyet.com/) can be checked for the status and examples of game related project for Rust.

Also check out the excellent [Roguelike tutoral in Rust](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/).
It is for 2D games but has a very nice introduction on how to use `Specs`, the entity-component-library used in Amethyst.
