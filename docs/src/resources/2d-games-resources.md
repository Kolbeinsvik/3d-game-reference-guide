## ggez, a game engine in rust

Rust library to create a Good Game Easily.
More specifically, ggez is a lightweight game framework for making 2D games with minimum friction.
It aims to implement an API based on (a Rustified version of) the LÃ–VE game framework.
Thus it contains portable 2D drawing, sound, resource loading and event handling.
ggez is not meant to be everything to everyone,
but rather a good base upon which to build higher-level systems and a useful tool that lets you immediately get started on projects such as game jams.
