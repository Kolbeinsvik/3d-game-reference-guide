# Programming languages

## Rust

Rust is a performant programming language focused on compile-time memory safety.

From the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

**Performance**:
Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

**Reliability**:
Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enable you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

**Productivity**:
Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.
